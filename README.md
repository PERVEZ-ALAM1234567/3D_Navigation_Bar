## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: The skeleton of the page, defining structure and content.
- **CSS3**: Modern styling techniques like **flexbox**, **CSS transforms**, and **pseudo-elements**.
- **FontAwesome**: A powerful font icon library that enhances the navigation bar with beautiful icons.

## How It Works

### HTML Structure:
The **HTML** structure is simple and clean. It consists of a list (`<ul>`) of navigation items (`<li>`), each containing an anchor tag (`<a>`) and a **FontAwesome** icon, which is dynamically inserted using the `data-icon` attribute.

### CSS Styling:
The **CSS** styles the navigation list with **flexbox**, ensuring that the items are neatly aligned both horizontally and vertically. Here's where the magic happens:
- **Skew Effect**: The entire list is skewed on the Y-axis to create a stylish, angled look.
- **Hover Transformations**: When you hover over each list item, its position changes slightly, and its background color transforms, creating a sleek interactive experience.
- **Icon Styling**: The icons are inserted before each list item using the `::before` pseudo-element and are styled with custom colors and effects to make them stand out.
- **Responsive Design**: The design adapts to different screen sizes to provide a seamless user experience on all devices.
